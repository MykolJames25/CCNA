If one end device places a frame on the media, no other device can do so until the frame has arrived at the destination and has been processed by the destination.

Each host can function as a server or a client based on the nature of the transaction and what resources are used or requested. One host might assume the server role when it receives requests for its resources, meanwhile it serves as a client in requesting resources from another host. The roles of client and server are set on a per request basis. However, for each transaction involved, a host serves either the role of a server or a client, not both."

In router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing, where a single physical interface routes traffic among multiple VLANs on a network, there is no practical scalability.

Multiple servers may be configured to respond to this request with DHCPOFFER messages. The client will choose the lease from one of the servers by sending a DHCPREQUEST message. It sends this message as a broadcast so that the other DHCP servers that sent offers will know that their offers were declined and the corresponding address can go back into the pool."

    "explanation":"SOHO and home broadband routers are typically set to acquire an IPv4 address automatically from the ISP. The IP address that is assigned is typically a dynamic address to reduce the cost, but a static IP address is possible with more cost. However, if the router is assigned a dynamic IP address, DNS issues will result in the web server behind the router not being easily accessible to the public. Routers are typically also gateways for LANs, but this has no bearing on whether the router is configured as a DHCP client on its WAN link or not. Likewise, a router can be configured to be a DHCP client in order to obtain an IP address from the ISP, but at the same time, it can be configured as a DHCP server to serve the IP addressing for the devices on its LAN."

    "explanation":"In order for syslog messages to be viewed, a syslog server must be installed on a computer in the network. There are several freeware and shareware versions of syslog, as well as enterprise versions for purchase. Network administrators can easily navigate the large amount of data that is compiled on a syslog server. One advantage of viewing syslog messages on a syslog server is the ability to perform granular searches through the data.�A syslog server is a database of informational messages that are received from network devices."

    "question":"A company is designing a network monitoring system and is considering SNMPv3. What are three characteristics of SNMPv3? (Choose three.)",
    "answerA":"It uses UDP port 514 to send event notifications to message collectors.",
    "answerB":"It uses message integrity to ensure that packets have not been altered in transit.",
    "answerC":"It uses expanded error codes to identify different types of error conditions.",
    "answerD":"It uses authentication to determine if messages are from a valid source.",

Telnet can do so by probing the TCP ports used by those applications. This is accomplished by adding the TCP port number as an argument in the Telnet command. Because the destination is a website, using a web browser can verify its functionality. To establish a management session (if the Telnet server is enabled on the web site), the telnet www.cisco.com command without the port argument could be used. Finally, the tracert www.cisco.com command should be used to identify the path to the server."

The ipconfig /flushdns command is used to purge the DNS cache. These two ipconfig commands will not solve the problem because the problem is not related to IPv4 configuration."
